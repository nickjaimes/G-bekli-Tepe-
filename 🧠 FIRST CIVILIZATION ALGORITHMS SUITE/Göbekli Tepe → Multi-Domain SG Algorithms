# 🧠 FIRST_CIVILIZATION_ALGORITHMS.md
**From Proto-Civilization Principles to Safeway Guardian Modules**

This file defines conceptual algorithms inspired by Göbekli Tepe and early civilization patterns, translated into reusable SG modules.

All examples are written in Python-style pseudocode for clarity.

```python

    Algorithms that enforce 'Intention before Implementation'.
    Derived from the idea that Göbekli Tepe was built for pure purpose,
    not survival or profit.

        """
        Evaluate how aligned a project is with SG core values:
        - Protect humanity
        - Increase resilience
        - Support long-term survival (100+ years)
        - Reduce suffering / risk
        Returns a score from 0.0 to 1.0

Example Uses
   •   SG SAFECOIN: decide which financial products to roll out first (emergency aid, calamity insurance, etc.)
   •   National Prosperity Engine: filter out “nice-to-have” vs. “civilization-critical” programs.
   •   TRINITY AI roadmap: prioritize features that protect users over purely “cool” ones.
