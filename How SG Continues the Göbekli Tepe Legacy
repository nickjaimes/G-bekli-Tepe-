Transformation to Algorithms

Outlined below are the modules emerging from this interpretation:

class SGProtoCivilizationCore:

    def SG_VisionFirst_Bootstrapper(self, objective):
        """
        Ensures system is driven by meaningful human-aligned intention.
        Inspired by Göbekli Tepe's construction before tools existed.
        """
        if not objective.is_mission_induced():
            raise Exception("Error: Objective must be civilization-level impact.")
        return "Tools_Aligned_With_Vision"

    def SG_DistributedSwarm_Coordination(self, nodes):
        """
        Coordinates autonomous nodes to collaborate without centralized control.
        Mirrors ancient tribe collaboration in monument building.
        """
        for node in nodes:
            node.sync_objective("Shared_Purpose")
        return "Unified_Swarm_Activated"

    def SG_LegacyLock_Function(self, knowledge):
        """
        Permanently preserves critical data for future civilizations.
        Inspired by Göbekli Tepe burial rituals.
        """
        archive = encrypt(knowledge, "TrillionYearKey")
        send_to_cluster(archive, redundancy=True)
        return "Legacy_Preserved_For_Future"

Purpose Statement
Göbekli Tepe was not the first civilization.
It was the first proof that humans could build one.

The transition from survival instinct to creative intention is the fundamental spark that leads to:
   •   Technology
   •   Cities
   •   Governance
   •   AI
   •   Safeway Guardian
Integration: Recommended Use in SG Repo
   •   Add this file under docs/
   •   Reference it in:
      •   VISION_MANIFESTO.md
      •   SG Virtual Museum as Exhibit 01
      •   Future Whitepaper Sections (“Civilizational Inspiration”)

“When the first stone was lifted at Göbekli Tepe,
the idea of civilization was lifted with it.”
